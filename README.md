# postgraphile-shopify-inflector

This plugin simplifies field names in the PostGraphile schema; e.g.
`allUsers` becomes simply `users`, `User.postsByAuthorId` becomes simply
`User.posts`, and `Post.userByAuthorId` becomes simply `Post.author`.

Mutations follow the Shopify style naming conventions. e.g. `createUser` becomes
`userCreate`.

**Adding this plugin to your schema is almost certainly a breaking change, so do
it before you ship anything!**

## Changes:

Given these tables:

```sql
create table companies (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);
create table beverages (
  id serial primary key,
  company_id int not null references companies,
  distributor_id int references companies,
  name text not null
);
```

- `Query.allCompanies` ðŸ‘‰ `Query.companies`
- `Query.allBeverages` ðŸ‘‰ `Query.beverages`
- `Beverage.companyByCompanyId` ðŸ‘‰ `Beverage.company`
- `Beverage.companyByDistributorId` ðŸ‘‰ `Beverage.distributor`
- `Company.beveragesByCompanyId` ðŸ‘‰ `Company.beverages` (because the `company_id` column follows the `[table_name]_id` naming convention)
- All update mutations now accept `patch` instead of `companyPatch` / `beveragePatch`
- All lists must either be a simple list or a connection. Not both.
- Fields where the singular and plural are the same and a distinct plural is required are force-pluralised ("fishes") to avoid conflicts (e.g. `singularize("fish") === pluralize("fish")`).

## Installation:

```bash
yarn add postgraphile-shopify-inflector
```

or

```bash
npm install --save postgraphile-shopify-inflector
```

## Usage:

CLI:

```bash
postgraphile --append-plugins postgraphile-shopify-inflector
```

Library:

```js
const PgShopifyInflectorPlugin = require("postgraphile-shopify-inflector");

// ...

app.use(
  postgraphile(process.env.AUTH_DATABASE_URL, "app_public", {
    appendPlugins: [PgShopifyInflectorPlugin],
  })
);
```

## Naming your foreign key fields

By naming your foreign key along the lines of `author_id` or `author_fk`, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id serial primary key,
  author_id int not null references users,
  ...
);
```

We can automatically extract the field prefix: `author` and call the relation
`author` rather than the default: `user`. This allows for a post to have an
`author`, `editor`, `reviewer`, etc. all which point to `users`.

The reverse, however, is not so easy. On the User type, we can't call the
reverse of all these different relations `posts`. The default inflector
refers to these as `postsByAuthorId`, `postsByEditorId`, etc. However we'd
rather use shorter names, so we introduce a new inflector:
`getOppositeBaseName`. This inflector is passed a baseName (the part without
the `_id`/`_fk` suffix, e.g. `author`, `editor`, `reviewer` above) and should
return the opposite of that base name which will be prepended to the target
type to produce, e.g. `authoredPosts`, `editedPosts`, `reviewedPosts`.
Failing this, we just fall back to the default (verbose) inflector; it will be
up to you to add smart comments or a custom inflector to override these.

## Handling field conflicts:

In most cases, the conflict errors will guide you on how to fix these issues
using [smart
comments](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/smart-comments/).
